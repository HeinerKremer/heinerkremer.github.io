I am a machine learning researcher at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/t-hkremer/?msockid=1c7319144a8c69541ab70d2e4be3688c) working on novel paradigms for diffusion, flow matching and language modeling. I did my PhD in machine learning with [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DZ-fHPgAAAAJ) at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ei.is.mpg.de/person/hkremer). Previously, I studied mathematics and physics in Cambridge and Frankfurt.

During my PhD I developed training algorithms for robust and causal machine learning based on [empirical likelihood estimation]({{ https://heinerkremer.github.io }}/assets/Empirical Likelihood.jpg). I also worked on inverse problems and temporal point processes.
